## House Pricing Project from Kaggle

### Overview

This repository contains my implementation of a House Pricing Project, a data analysis and machine learning project, based on the [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) competition from Kaggle.

The goal of this project is to predict house prices based on various features like the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, area, location, etc. The dataset includes both training and test data, where the training data contains features along with corresponding house prices. The model trained on this data will be used to predict house prices for the test data.

### Contents

- `train.csv`: This file contains the training dataset in CSV format.
- `House_Prices.ipynb`: google Colab notebooks for data exploration, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation.
- `data_description.txt`: full description of each column, originally prepared by Dean De Cock but lightly edited to match the column names used here

### Summary:

The work in this project can be summarized as follows:

1. Data Exploration: The project begins with a thorough exploration of the dataset. Various statistical measures, visualizations, and data insights are analyzed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the data.

2. Data Preprocessing: The dataset may contain missing values, categorical variables, and outliers. Data preprocessing techniques such as encoding, and scaling are applied to handle these issues and prepare the data for modeling.

3. Feature Engineering: New features are derived from the existing data to enhance the predictive power of the models. Feature engineering involves selecting and transforming relevant features that may improve the model's performance.

4. Model Selection and Tuning: XGBoost Regressor was used in building the machine learning model. Different hyperparameters are tuned to optimize the model's performance.

5. Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using various metrics, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The best-performing model is selected based on these evaluation metrics.

6. Prediction: The final selected model is used to predict house prices for the test dataset.

Overall, the House Pricing Project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to data analysis and machine learning, with a focus on predicting house prices. The combination of data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation ensures that the project's outcome is accurate and reliable.
